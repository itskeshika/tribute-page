            <p>Stephen Hawking was a world-renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist.</p>

            <h4>Here is a short information about life of Hawking:</h4>
            <div class="life">
                <ul>
                    <li>8 January 1942: He was born in oxford into the family of physicians.</li>
                    <li>October 1959: At the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford,
                        where he received a first-class BA degree in physics.</li>
                    <li>1963: At age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor
                        neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him</li>
                    <li>14 July 1965: Married to Jane Wilde whom he met at a party in their shared hometown
                        st.Albanas.The couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967,Lucy, born November 1970,and
                        Timothy, born April 1979</li>
                    <li>March 1966: He obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics,
                        specialising in general relativity and cosmology.</li>

                <h4>Here are some achievements of Hawking:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1970: Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the
                        event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.[90] With James M. Bardeen and Brandon
                        Carter.</li>
                    <li>1974: He found out that Black hole emit radiation known as Hawking's radiation,which may
                        continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate.</li>
                    <li> 1975: He was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal</li>
                    <li>1976: The Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal.</li>
                    <li>1979: Hawking was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge</li>
                    <li>1983: Published a model, known as the Hartleâ€“Hawking state. It proposed that prior to the Planck
                        epoch, the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and
                        the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.</li>
                    <li>After 1985 to 1990: The Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1985),the Paul Dirac Medal
                        and, jointly with Penrose, the prestigious Wolf Prize (1988). In the 1989 Birthday Honours, he
                        was appointed a Companion of Honour.He reportedly declined a knighthood in the late 1990s in
                        objection to the UK's science funding policy</li>
                    <li>1993: He co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a
                        collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.</li>
                    <li>2006: Hawking developed a theory of top-down cosmology, which says that the universe had not one
                        unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to
                        formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular
                        initial state</li>

                <h4>Why Hawking should be appreciated?( my personal view ) :</h4>
                <p>Hawking was a great physicist and cosmologist with a high intellect.Stephen Hawking made significant
                    contributions to the field of theoretical physics and cosmology, and his work has had a lasting
                    impact on our understanding of the universe. Some of the reasons why he is highly regarded and why
                    people may be grateful for his contributions include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>He made groundbreaking discoveries in the field of general relativity, including the theoretical
                        prediction of Hawking radiation, which demonstrated that black holes are not completely black.
                    </li>
                    <li>He made significant contributions to the study of the Big Bang theory and the origins of the
                        universe.</li>
                    <li>He helped to bring complex scientific ideas to a wider audience through his popular science
                        books, including "A Brief History of Time," which became a bestseller and helped to increase
                        public interest in science.</li>
                    <li>He was a passionate advocate for science education and the importance of scientific research.
                    </li>
                    <li>Despite facing significant physical challenges due to his motor neuron disease, Hawking
                        continued to work and make important contributions to his field, inspiring many people with his
                        determination and spirit.</li>
